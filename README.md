# Yurivania: Uhaul of the Night 🌱🐍

This is my entry to [YuriJam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/yuri-game-jam-2020): an adventure game with a metroidvania style.

Stheno the gorgon wants her girlfriend Alraune to move in, but to accommodate a plantgirl Stheno's room needs an overhaul!
Hopefully their castle community can provide everything they need to make the space comfy for both of them!

Explore the Midnight Palace, ask your girlfriends and other monstergirls for help, and make the perfect two-lady lovenest!
You might have to avoid some nasty traps or trounce a creepy human along the way, but in the end love always wins!

# How to Play 🧛‍♀️🏰

# Goals 👭🕸️

I wanted to create something cute, simple, and gay over the course of the two month jam.
I liked the idea of working with a toolset I'd never used before.
I chose a system with significant technical constraints, as fewer choices mean faster development.

# Features 🎭🗺️

1. 2D side-scrolling exploration.
2. Inventory-based puzzle solving.
3. Environmental hazards to avoid.
4. Several characters to interact with.
5. A map system.

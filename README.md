# Yurivania: Uhaul of the Night

This is my entry to [YuriJam 2020](https://itch.io/jam/yuri-game-jam-2020): an adventure game with a metroidvania style.

Players take the role of Stheno, a gorgon who is hoping her girlfriend Alraune will move in with her.
But to accomodate a plantgirl Stheno's room will need an overhaul!
Hopefully their castle community can provide everything necessary to make a comfy space for them both....

# Status

Right now the game is unfinished and cannot be played!  Expected delivery date is *November 30th, 2020*.

# How to Play

Once done, the game will be available on Itch.

# Goals

I wanted to create something cute, simple, and gay over the course of the two month jam.
I liked the idea of working with a toolset I'd never used before.
I chose a system with significant technical constraints, as fewer choices mean faster development.

# Features

1. A peaceful 2D side-scrolling map that may be explored.
2. Inventory-based puzzle solving.
3. Several characters to interact with.
4. A map system.

# Requirements

This game was built with *GB Studio 2.0-beta-4*, using [Tiled](http://www.mapeditor.org/), and [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/), and [OpenMPT](https://openmpt.org/).
To work with this repo you only need [GB Studio 2.0](https://chrismaltby.itch.io/gb-studio).
